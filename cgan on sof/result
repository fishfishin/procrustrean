happy emotion synthesis at first 20 epochs through fc NN and gray images ,
however at the very end , the mode collapses and the G loss is always almost 0,
while D loss converges periodically after a sudden huge rise to 1e+3 or 1e+4
After I normalise the image value range to 0-1, then the D loss down to about 7 hundreds , very high yet.
And the generated images still with many noises.


As for Cgan with conv layer, I tried with NVidia Mx150 but there was a warning ," always exceeds 10% of system memory".
