To realize the translation from one emotion to another. It is like image mapping of two kinds of different domains.

The basic framework is from the paper [Double Encoder Conditional GAN for Facial Expression Synthesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328179213_Double_Encoder_Conditional_GAN_for_Facial_Expression_Synthesis)
